# Coinbase: Beneath The Surface

## Overview and Origin
Coinbase Inc is a technology company that provides data and transaction processing services. The company was co-founded by CEO Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam (Bloomberg). In 2012, Armstrong co-founded Coinbase and gave a budding demographic of cryptocurrency enthusiasts the opportunity to trade in their USD for bitcoins, and later the digital currency of their choice. Coinbase currently serves over 10 million customers across 32 countries, providing custody for more than $10 billion in digital assets (TechCrunch). 

Coinbase was first funded by Y Combinator. In 2012, co-founder Fred Ehrsam, a former Goldman Sachs trader, joined the company, after which Coinbase launched services to buy, sell, and store bitcoin (CB Insights). Coinbase is funded by 57 investors. True Capital Management and Fundamental Labs are the most recent investors. Coinbase has raised a total of $547.3M in funding over 14 rounds. Their latest funding was raised on Dec 21, 2018 from a Secondary Market round (CrunchBase).

## Business Activities

Coinbase's long awaited and much anticipated public offering appears near after the cryptocurrency trading platform filed paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday February 25, 2021 (MarketWatch). The revenue structure of the company poses its biggest risk, given the fact that its fate is linked to the prospects for Bitcoin and ethereum and the thousands of other alternative coins that have just been written into existence and will continue to face resistance from the centralized monetary system. Coinbase wrote in its S-1 filing, "If demand for these crypto assets declines and is not replaced by new demand for crypto assets, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.” It will be interesting to see what strategy Coinbase develops to offset the risk of being fully dependent on the future of cryptocurrency.

Coinbase is tailored specifically towards the retail cryptoinvestor, a good comparison of its platform would be the Robinhood of cryptocurrency exchange. On the Coinbase website, they boast "We are building the cryptoeconomy – a more fair, accessible, efficient, and transparent financial system enabled by crypto." Approximately 43 million verified users, 7,000 institutions, and 115,000 ecosystem partners in over 100 countries trust Coinbase to easily and securely invest, spend, save, earn, and use crypto (Coinbase). Coinbase is the largest cyrpto exchange in America and 3rd largest in the world with a current volume of $3,043,777,414 (Coinmarketcap). Compared with that of its biggest competitor, Binance, Coinbase is not accessible in as many countries and does not support some of the less known coins; however, customer support and ease of use of the platform are far superior in ratings with that of Binance (Bitdegree). Though trading fees are signifnicantly higher on Coinbase, withdrawal fees are lower than Binance (Bitdegree).

CoinBase uses many different type of technologies to maximize user experience and platform efficiency. One new technology they use is container technology. Companies choose to containerize their applications to increase engineering output/developer productivity in a quick, safe, and reliable manner. Containers enable engineers to develop, test, and run their applications locally in the same or similar manner that they will run in other environments (Coinbase blog). Containers enable a parallel system of collaboration resulting in quicker decisions.

Another technology implemented by Coinbase is Bazel monorepo. This system was designed in order to combat the problem of having multiple mircroservices integrating with various payment partners which resulted in frequent code replication (Coinbaseblog). The solution this technology offers is accomplished by migrating the payment services into a single monorepo.
